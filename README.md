I am excited to see how this function and others can be used to save and load in my own projects. I believe I added the -3 value in the right place, but I apologize if I did not. 

# E07a-Save-and-Load    

This is an opportunity for you to practice the simplest form of saving state in Godot, saving to a config file.

As always, Fork and Clone this repository.

This exercise is taken from the [Basic Saving In Godot With Config Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygGaN1EOQEA) by Eric Davidson. His video will guide you through the steps required to save a value (in this case, the DisplayValue) to a config file and retrieve it when the player pushes the Save and Load buttons.

His tutorial was developed using Godot 3.1. Everything you see should be compatible with Godot 3.2, although some of the syntax highlighting might look slightly different.

After you have completed the exercise, run the program. Save a value of -3 to the config file. Update the LICENSE and README.md, and then turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.
